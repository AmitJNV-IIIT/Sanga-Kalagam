 Conclusion

This app was developed by noticing the social issue with neighbours
in our society where most of the people do not know about there
neighbours and area. By taking this into notice I have developed this
app to solve this issue.

Sanga kalagam app allows individuals to keep in touch with friends and extended family. The app can be updated or modified in future with respect to user
requirment. The app can be updated by making changes in user interface, user interaction and customer support.
